# exeris-caps-credential-store

Password credentials as an Exeris capability. It provides `CredentialStore` (set, verify and change a password, with a lockout after repeated failures), `AccountVerification` (single-use, expiring email-verification tokens) and `CredentialRecovery` (password-reset tokens and their consumption). Tokens are stored hashed.

Status: proof of concept, built against `exeris-kernel` 0.13.0-SNAPSHOT. The API is not stable and no artefact has been published.

## Where it sits

- **Layer:** Layer 5 — Domain primitive (identity), in the Tier 2 capability map of [`high-level-architecture.md`](https://github.com/exeris-systems/exeris-docs/blob/main/high-level-architecture.md) §3.2.
- **Depends on:** `exeris-kernel-spi`, `exeris-sdk-composition-lifecycle` and `exeris-caps-audit-trail`.
- **Provides** (`@Provides`, all version 1.0.0): `CredentialStore`, `AccountVerification`, `CredentialRecovery`.
- **Requires** (`@Requires`, each declared `optional = true`): `eu.exeris.caps.credentialstore.spi.NotificationDispatcher`, `eu.exeris.kernel.spi.security.credentials.KernelPasswordEncoder`, `eu.exeris.kernel.spi.persistence.TransactionalExecutor`, `eu.exeris.caps.credentialstore.spi.SessionStore`, `eu.exeris.caps.audittrail.api.AuditLogSink`.
- **Wall (ADR-055):** `eu.exeris.caps.credentialstore.api` is the cross-cap surface; `eu.exeris.caps.credentialstore.internal` is private, and a sibling cap reaching into it fails the build. No Spring, servlet, Netty or reactive type may appear (ADR-006).

Behaviour worth knowing before composing it:

- Passwords are encoded with the kernel's `KernelPasswordEncoder`. When none is supplied the module looks for the kernel community Argon2id encoder on the classpath and fails if it is absent rather than falling back to a weaker one.
- Storage is in memory unless a kernel `TransactionalExecutor` is supplied, in which case a PostgreSQL repository is used. The DDL is `src/main/resources/schema/credential-store-schema.sql`; nothing applies it automatically.
- Delivering a verification or reset token, and revoking sessions on a password change, go through two interfaces this cap declares itself (`spi.NotificationDispatcher`, `spi.SessionStore`); in-memory implementations of both ship in that package.

## Build & test

Requires JDK 25 and Maven 3.9+.

```bash
mvn compile -Dexeris.codegen.skip=true   # pass 1 — the processor writes capability metadata
mvn verify                               # pass 2 — generate cap-manifest.json, validate the graph, scan the Wall
```

Both passes are needed after a `clean`: `exeris:generate` runs before `compile`, and `compile` is when the processor writes the metadata it reads. `src/main/generated/java/cap-manifest.json` is committed, so a clean `git status` after `mvn verify` shows the manifest matches the declaration.

The upstreams are not on Maven Central. `exeris-sdk` v0.12.0 and `exeris-tooling` v0.9.0 are built from source at those tags, and `exeris-kernel` 0.13.0-SNAPSHOT is resolved from GitHub Packages, which needs a token with `read:packages`; the sibling `exeris-caps-service-boundary-core` and `exeris-caps-audit-trail` are built from source first. [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml) is the exact sequence, and [`.github/maven-settings.xml`](.github/maven-settings.xml) the repository configuration it uses.

## License

Exeris Commercial License 1.1 — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). `exeris-caps-credential-store` is a `commercial` capability under [ADR-023](https://github.com/exeris-systems/exeris-docs/blob/main/adr/ADR-023-capability-licensing-taxonomy.md): the source is available to read, build, test and evaluate, and production use requires a commercial licence.

The cap enforces that at boot. It registers a kernel `EntitlementRequirement` whose capability id is `exeris-caps-credential-store`, and in a production-class environment the kernel's contract gate refuses to start unless a signed licence manifest lists that id among its entitlements ([ADR-088](https://github.com/exeris-systems/exeris-docs/blob/main/adr/ADR-088-cryptographic-license-manifest-and-offline-verification.md), [ADR-089](https://github.com/exeris-systems/exeris-docs/blob/main/adr/ADR-089-capability-entitlement-enforcement-and-runtime-contract.md)).
